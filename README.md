Hi, I’m @coaksford.

I’m interested in resilient systems, and mostly focused on federated systems, peer to peer systems, and self-hosting, secondarily interested in microkernel operating systems.

I’m currently learning Rust, Go, Haskell, and Python.

I also enjoy teaching people who are completely new to programming to get them started.
