Hi, I’m @coaksford.

I like teaching people what I know (mostly Rust and Go) and learning new stuff (currently Haskell and Nix).

I like to self-host what I can, and use self-hosting as a place to learn. I wouldn't say I'm a homelabber because people doing that are doing very different things than me, but I've done stuff like self-host email, DNS, matrix, XMPP, Minecraft servers, Teamspeak servers, NVRs, NASes, websites, and plenty more.
